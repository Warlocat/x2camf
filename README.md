# X2CAMF
An efficient implementation of atomic relativistic four-component Hartree-Fock calculation
with spherical symmetry and two-electron Coulomb and Breit interaction. The X2CAMF program 
can generate spin-orbit integrals within the exact two-component theory with atomic-mean-field 
integral (the X2CAMF scheme, which has the same name as the program).

For a detailed description of X2CAMF scheme and the implementation of spherical symmetry, 
please see https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpca.2c02181.
